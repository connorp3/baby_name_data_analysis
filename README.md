### Notes/Assumptions

First, I assumed that ties in rankings of name frequency were
broken by alphabetical ranking.  This significantly simplified the code
that had to generate rankings for names, as all the names that are
tied in frequency for a given year are already in alphabetical order.
For the third question, I assumed again that any ties in names that were
ranked number one most frequently for a range of years would be broken by
alphabetical rankings. Thus, for the third question, my program returns only
the first name lexicographically, even though there may be multiple names 
tied for most number one rankings. For the fourth question, I assumed that
"most popular letter that names started with" meant the letter with the most
aggregate instances of people beginning with that letter.
